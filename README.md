## Slightly Longer Instructions
This game is played used just the spacebar. 

By tapping the spacebar, players  cycle through rows on the board. Once a desired row is selected, pressing and holding the spacebar enters that row and switches the game into column selection mode. 

Once in column selection mode, tapping the spacebar cycles through columns in the selected row. Pressing and holding in this mode marks a column with either an X or an O and advances the turn. 

Players can also tap the spacebar twice in quick succession to exit column selection mode and return to row selection mode without marking a square.

Once a player has won, or the game ends in a tie, a dialog will appear announcing the winner. Tapping space now clears the dialog and resets the board for the next game.
